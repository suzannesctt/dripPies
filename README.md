# driPies

Various raspberry pi-based watering systems.

## Version 1.0

Version 1.0 was designed to be used inside, to water a few plants while I am away.  It uses two 3-6V submersible pumps, controlled from a raspberry pi via a relay, to pump water through some tubing onto some potplants.

## Version 2.0

Version 2.0 was designed to be used on a balcony (with no mains water tap but with power points), again to water a few plants while I am away.  It uses a slightly more powerful (mains-electricty powered) pump, controlled via a radio-frequency power socket, to pump water onto some plants.  It incorporated a sensor to warn of a nearly empty water reservoir.
